# Who am I?

I’m just an enthusiast when it comes to everything related to crypto and other blockchain applications.  
I’ve primarily settled in the COSMOS ecosystem but am also familiar with EVM-based blockchains and the Bitcoin Ordinals Protocol.  
My introduction to the crypto space occurred in 2017 when I bought and held Bitcoin until I evolved into a "DeGen" and swapped it all for EVM-native coins, only to get rekt in the aftermath. However, I learned valuable lessons from the experience. It may have cost me a lot, but it was worth every dollar.

Alongside the rocky path and steep learning curve, I graduated from:  
- [Ambassadors School](https://ambassadors.school/)  
and  
- [Validator School](https://validators.network/) in 2022  

When I’m not sitting in front of the screen doing "degen" crypto stuff, I work as a freelance interpreter and translator for courts, police departments, hospitals, and many other interesting clients.
