# Who or what am I?
I´m a very enthusiastic fella in regards of everything that´s gotta do with crypto and other blockchain applications. <br />
I preferably settled down in the COSMOS ecosystem but am however also familiar with EVM based blockchains. <br />
My introduction to the crypto space occured first in 2017 by buying and holding Bitcoin until I evolved into a DeGen and swapped it all for EVM native coins to then get rekt in the aftermath but learn valuable lessons. <br /> <br />
Now here I am, having finished the 
- [Ambassadors School](https://ambassadors.school/) <br />
and
- [Validator School](https://validators.network/) in 2022 <br /> <br />

When I´m not sitting in front of the screen and doing DeGen crypto stuff, I work as a freelance translator for courts, police departments, hospitals etc.
